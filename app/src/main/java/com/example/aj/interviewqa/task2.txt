Task 2: 
Please provide a solution to check if a number is a prime number using a loop of one - O(1). The input number can be between 1 and 10000 only.

Answer:
I do not think plain lookup with runtime of O(1) is possible on an array. The best we can do 
is ASK algorithm with run-time of O((log n)^6). However if we check and store the 
numbers we could get close to O(1)

lets say we have this Number data-structure

class Number {
	int number;
	boolean isPrime;
}

If we check and store all the 10,000 number in this format then we lookup with O(1)

Number[10001] numStore;

boolean check(int x){
	return numStore[x].isPrime; 	
}

I asked on Stackoverflow and got the simliar answer to mine, 
If you have a solution please share, it's killing me
